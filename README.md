This web application allows users to dynamically display and filter a menu of items. Whether you're showcasing a restaurant menu, product catalog, or any list of items, this project provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The user interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Category Filtering:** Users can filter the displayed items by selecting different categories using interactive filter buttons.


## Technologies Used
